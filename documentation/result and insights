## 🧭 1. Overview Page – Business Performance

### 📊 Key Findings:
- **Total Revenue** increased year-on-year, with the highest sales volume recorded in **2024**. The business appears to be on a growth trajectory.
- **May** consistently emerged as the peak sales month across all three years, indicating a strong seasonal trend.
- **Average Order Value (AOV)** remained steady between ₦27,000 and ₦29,000, showing that basket size is consistent across customers and years.
- The **Order Status Breakdown** revealed that **~92%** of all orders were delivered, **6% shipped**, and **2% pending**. These pending orders may represent fulfillment delays or customer-side issues.
- **Revenue Trend Line** indicated sharp dips in December and January — likely due to holiday fatigue or inventory constraints.

### 💡 Recommendations:
- **Double down on Q2 marketing campaigns**, especially in April–May.
- **Investigate fulfillment delays** tied to pending/shipped orders — consider automating order tracking and shipment reminders.
- Implement **holiday promotions** to address Q4 slumps, possibly with bundles or time-limited discounts.

## 👥 2. Customer Page – Behavior & Segmentation

### 📊 Key Findings:
- Out of 828 customers, a core group (~150) contributed to over **60%** of revenue, validating the **Pareto Principle**.
- **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)** revealed a top-tier segment with lifetime revenues exceeding ₦100,000 — these should be the focus of loyalty efforts.
- **Order Frequency Segmentation** using NTILE showed:
  - 25% of customers ordered just once
  - 50% ordered between 2–4 times
  - 25% ordered 5+ times
- The **Country matrix** showed dominant sales from Nigeria, Ghana, and Côte d'Ivoire — however, emerging activity was also seen in Sierra Leone and Senegal.

### 💡 Recommendations:
- Launch **personalized campaigns** for top LTV customers — early access to sales, loyalty rewards, or tiered memberships.
- **Re-engagement campaigns** for one-time buyers using discount codes or abandoned cart nudges.
- Expand **localization efforts** in regions with growing traffic (e.g., French translations for Côte d'Ivoire and Senegal).

### ⚠️ Observations:
- There’s no gender or age segmentation in the dataset, which limits demographic-based targeting. Consider integrating such data for deeper personas.

## 📦 3. Product Page – Revenue and Inventory Drivers

### 📊 Key Findings:
- Top 10 products drove **~47%** of total revenue.
- **Clothing** and **Accessories** were the best-selling categories.
- Conditional formatting on the product table revealed consistent performance from mid-priced products (₦10,000–₦30,000).
- Several products appeared in the system but had **zero sales** or **missing price values** — a data quality concern.

### 💡 Recommendations:
- Replenish and promote **top-selling SKUs** regularly to avoid stockouts during peak seasons.
- Introduce **product bundling strategies** (e.g., socks + shoes or caps + shirts) to increase AOV.
- Investigate **products with 0 sales** — check for incorrect pricing, lack of visibility on the platform, or inventory issues.
- Perform regular **data audits** to ensure no missing values or pricing errors in the master product table.

## 🧩 Cross-Functional Insights

### 📌 Operational Bottlenecks:
- Pending orders investigations should be carried out at each warehouse — operations should review delay causes.
- Customers with frequent returns (refund cases) had lower LTV — a flag for potential abuse or poor product fit.

### 🧠 Strategic Opportunities:
- Identify **promotions or events** tied to peak months to replicate success (e.g., May Flash Sales).
- Introduce **RFM Analysis** (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) as a next step to sharpen customer segmentation.
- Enable **real-time dashboards** to support sales/marketing teams with quicker decision-making.
