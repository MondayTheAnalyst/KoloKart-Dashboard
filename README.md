# 📊 Kolokart (Power BI Project)

## 🛍️ Project Story

This Power BI report is the visual companion to my Kolokart SQL project — a fictional e-commerce brand created to reflect the real-world data challenges of online retail. The dashboard brings the data to life through rich, dynamic visuals focused on business performance, customer behavior, and product trends.

## 🧭 Dashboard Overview

The Power BI report is divided into three core pages:

### 1️⃣ Overview Page
Gives a high-level summary of the business performance, with clear KPIs and visual highlights.

**Key Features:**
- Total Revenue and Orders
- Average Order Value
- Order Status Breakdown (Delivered, Shipped, etc.)
- Revenue Trend Line Chart (Monthly)
- Top Products by Revenue (Bar Chart)

### 2️⃣ Customer Page
Focuses on customer behavior and segmentation insights.

**Key Visuals:**
- Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) 
- Order Frequency Segmentation (NTILE)
- Average Order Value by Country 

### 3️⃣ Product Page
Highlights product-level performance and contribution to overall sales.

**Key Visuals:**
- Product Table with Category, Revenue, Units Sold, and % of Total Revenue
- Conditional Formatting for Top Performers
- Searchable Product Breakdown

Each page is interactive, filterable, and designed to simulate a dashboard an actual e-commerce manager would use to track performance.
